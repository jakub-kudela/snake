# Snake

A simple game made in **Pascal** in 2009. It is a variation of a well known video game called Snake.
The code itself is pretty unreadable as I had no previous experience with any best practices.
However, I still have feelings for this project because it was my first self-programmed game.

## Installation

The code is compilable with the **Turbo Pascal 7.0 compiler** (**TPC.exe**).
One of the possible ways how to compile the code on Windows 10 is by using **DOSBox**.
The beginning of the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhRqh4NWYys) shows the compilation process.
